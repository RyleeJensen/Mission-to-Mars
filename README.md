# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview
The purpose of this project was to scrape information from multiple web pages regarding facts about Mars. This was done using Chrome Developer tools to help identify HTML components of each webpage, using Beautiful Soup and Splinter to automate a web browser and perform the scraping, using MongoDB to store all the data, and finally using Flask in order to create a web application in order to display the data. The following is the information that we scraped about the planet Mars:
  - The Latest News
